## What next?

What to learn next?
For most of you, this quick introduction to Postman will be enough to have the knowledge required to use Postman at work.

I also have a much longer class (18+ hours), [Postman: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/postman-the-complete-guide/?referralCode=4E8B90BA4B5EE8DA9237), which goes much deeper. You may not need it, but I suggest taking over the [curriculum](https://www.udemy.com/course/postman-the-complete-guide/?referralCode=4E8B90BA4B5EE8DA9237) to decide for yourself if it is worth taking.

If you are unsure, just drop me a message. I am happy to help and point you in the right direction.
